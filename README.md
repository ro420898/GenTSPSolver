## Introduction

This project implements a Genetic Algorithm to solve the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP), a classic combinatorial optimization challenge. The algorithm evolves a population of routes over multiple generations, aiming to find the most optimal path that visits all cities exactly once and returns to the starting city.
