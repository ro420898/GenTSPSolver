The Traveling Salesman Problem is a combinatorial optimization problem. The classical formulation of the problem is as follows: given a list of cities and the distances between each pair of cities, the objective is to find the shortest route that visits each city exactly once and returns to the starting point.

This project seeks to create an algorithm that solves the traveling salesman problem using genetic algorithms.
