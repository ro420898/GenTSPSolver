## Introduction

This project implements a Genetic Algorithm to solve the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP), a classic combinatorial optimization challenge. The algorithm evolves a population of routes over multiple generations, aiming to find the most optimal path that visits all cities exactly once and returns to the starting city.

## Features

- **Genetic Algorithm:**
  - Efficiently solves the TSP by employing evolutionary principles such as selection, crossover, and mutation.

- **NumPy Integration:**
  - Utilizes NumPy for efficient numerical operations, particularly in calculating Euclidean distances.

- **Matplotlib Visualization:**
  - Matplotlib is employed to visualize the best route found, providing a clear representation of the optimized solution.

- **Documentation:**
  - Well-commented code with docstrings to enhance code understanding.

## Results
  - The algorithm converges over generations to find an approximate solution to the TSP, visualized through the Matplotlib plot.

## Acknowledgments
